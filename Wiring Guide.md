Wiring/Mocking

I made custom wires because I did not want to pay a lot of money for one. 
I measured the length of my test subject, which is a 2019 Yamaha r3. 
Measured where the Arduino will sit to the front/rear sensor and LCD screen.
(See in Images for an idea of how I made them)

Tools
- Wire strippers
- Small pliers
- Helper's hands
- OPTIONAL labeler
- Angled pick
- Measuring Tape

- Lots of 22 AWG wire (Recommend having different colors)
- 22 AWG male/female connectors
- Techflex to protect wires
- Heatshrink to tie up ends
