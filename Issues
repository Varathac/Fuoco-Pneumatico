The screen I used is a Hosyond 3.5 inch 320x480 IPS Capacitive Touch Screen LCD.
This screen has the newer type of driver ILI9488 than what the description says on Amazon.
You can use any screen you prefer. Just have to find the correct library to make it work for you.

The problem I ran into with the LCD screen was when an input is updated, the whole screen would refresh which looks terrible.
To combat this I used a library from FlickerFreePrint which works in tandem with Adafruit ST7796S.
For the target item, I assigned a special name to put the updating input into.
This will get rid of the whole screen refreshing and only manipulating what is changing.

This project is made using the Arduino uno Rev 3, not the latest one with an LED matrix on the board.
If youâ€™re going to connect more than 2 sensors, I recommend just getting a multiplexer to make it easier.
For my case I combine the wire together and have the sensor in parallel.
You would have to change the address of the sensor prior to make them read different input, otherwise it would find the average between the two.


I used a prebuilt IR thermal camera to make this work (MLX). You can use any sensor you want just to find the correct library and codes.
You can get a more precise temp of a specific object if your purchase the MLX sensor with a scope like attachment.
In our case, I more focused on the sleek look on the motorcycle where as a car I would make 3 sensor per tire.
