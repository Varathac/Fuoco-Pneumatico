💡 No soldering is required for this part of the process.
Following Formula 1 wiring standards, we’ll be crimping rather than soldering for durability and serviceability.

⚙️ Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Measure Wire Length

Determine the correct wire length from the Arduino/Display to both the front and rear wheels.

2. Prepare the Wire

Slide the waterproof seal over the wire, then strip it to prepare for crimping the terminals to the connector head.

3. Match Connector Pin Labels

Each connector has labeled positions such as A, B, C, D.
Match the pins from each side accordingly.

4. Insert Terminals into Connectors

After crimping the terminals, insert them into the connector head:

Female terminals → Female connectors

Male terminals → Male connectors

5. Verify Wire Orientation

Ensure that the colored wires align in the same position on both connectors.

6. Apply Heat Shrink

Finally, wrap Raychem heat shrink tubing around the connections.
This provides:

Weather resistance

Mechanical protection

Fire retardancy
