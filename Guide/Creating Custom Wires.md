Thankfully there won't be any soldering on this part of the process.
1. Measure the correct length of wire you need to reach where the IR temperature sensor will be to the Arduino.
2. Use the wire stripper to expose the correct amount of copper strand to both the female and male Molex.

4. Crimp the guided spot of the Molex to the strand of wires to make a solid connection.
5. You can approach this in multiple ways. I recommend putting a layer of protection such as a techflex but you can leave it as is if you wish. In this guide, I will be using Tech Flex to add additional protection against the weather, rocks, and debris.

7. It is important to organize the wire so that you know where each end-to-end of the wire is. I grouped the wires into 2, 3, and 4 wires into a Tech Flex sleeve.

9. After getting the wire into the sleeve, add a heat shrink at the end of the Tech Flex.

11. It is optional to print out a label for each wire and cover it with clear heat shrink to help organize.
